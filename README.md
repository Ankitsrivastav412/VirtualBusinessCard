first we have to install Some important dependencies like -
Express - to create Server;
mongoose - to connect nodejs with database & defining Schema;
Multer - to Send files in formdata;
aws-sdk -to generate public link to store in our database;

In this Project  we have to Make Model i.e (BusinessCardModel) in which we define Our Schema.

Afterthat In controller we write the Logics & for Validation we create another folder and import in Controller.
and then we write our Api in route file.
After that we test our Api's which we have Built.
